Multi Level inverters provide several benefits for power electronic conversion,
such as low total harmonic distortion (THD), simple control techniques, compactness,
dependability, and the capacity to control a greater amount of power in the form of high voltages and currents,
which have made this technology increasingly important in the last several years.
These inverters also feature a low operating cost and highly efficient renewable power
generators with high dependability. The best-known multilevel inverter structures are the cascaded
H-bridge inverter, the flying capacitor inverter, and the diode clamping inverter.
